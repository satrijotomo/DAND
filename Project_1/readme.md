### Stroop Task
In this project, a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect is the main investigation topic. I will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task. Some data collected from others who have performed the same task have been provided and I will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, I interpret the results in terms of hypotheses.

### Hypotheses & Stastistical Test Used
The variables in this test are:
Independent variable: Word formats, congruent and incongruent
Dependent variable: Performance, time to name the ink colors

The Ho states that the population does not have significantly different performance means between congruent and incongruent. On the opposite, the alternative hypothesis states that there is significant difference between congruent and incongruent population mean.

To determine if we can reject Ho or not, I use Excelâ€™s Data Analysis tool to perform dependent t-test, specifically, the t-test paired two sample for means.

### Result
Because the P(t) value of t-test is 2.0515E-08, which is much smaller than value 0.05 (alpha), there is enough evident to reject Ho and we can conclude that there is significant performance difference between congruent and incongruent.
