Explarotary Data Analysis Project
=================================
In this project, I use R and apply exploratory data analysis techniques to explore relationships in one variable to multiple variables and to explore a selected data set for distributions, outliers, and anomalies. The dataset used is from Prosper Loan. This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, borrower credit history, and the latest payment information.
The folder contains the rmd file to be used with R Studio and the html file knitted from the rmd.
