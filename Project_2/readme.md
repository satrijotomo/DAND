Project 2: Titanic Data

Based on data of 91 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic, I examined various variables in the dataset to find if there are correlations between them and the survivability of the passengers. The training dataset was retrieved from Kaggle.

Please note that the analysis does not utilize machine learning, and the correlation between variables are calculated by using Pearson R score.
